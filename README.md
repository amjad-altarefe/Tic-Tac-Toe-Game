# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Our python code lets you play Tic-Tac-Toe in two ways:  1. One Player Mode: You against the computer with a smart opponent.  2. Two Player Mode: Play against a friend.  The computer's moves in the one-player mode are determined using the minimax algorithm,  making it a challenging opponent.
